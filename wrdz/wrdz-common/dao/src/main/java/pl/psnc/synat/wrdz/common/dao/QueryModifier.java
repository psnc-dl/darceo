 * This interface defines the contract of classes allowing to modify given query.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To ensure that all parameters are derived from and concern the same query it is crucial to create them at the same
 * time using the same objects (factories and builders) parameterized by the same persistence context dependent objects.
 * This interface defines the structures that defines this contract.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Following the concept presented in above paragraph, creators returned by this interface must be marked bu some unique
 * value indicating their common origin. This is done by the epoch counter - creators connected by common origin get the
 * same, unique value which is also used to mark the objects created by them. Thus it is easy to check if the parts of
 * the query belong to the same query (marked by epoch value).
